    %h1 What is this all about?
    %p
      %strong tl;dr
    %p
      Learn Testing is a site that helps you identify what you can learn in the world of software
      testing. It also helps you keep track of what you know and how you confident you feel in
      applying your skills.
    %p
      %strong why?
    %p
      Because finding out what you don't know is hard.

      %strong The longer, substantially cooler, detailed explaination
    %p
      In 2010 I conducted a
      = link_to 'survey', "http://distributedlife.com/content/paper.futures%20in%20software%20testing.pdf"
      that found that 75% of testers surveyed were unaware of the different
      directions a testing career could go. It also highlighted that 64% of testers surveyed had
      insufficient information to develop the capabilities required for their desired career path.
    %p
      Learn Testing is a site to help you identify what you currently know and what you can learn
      in software testing. We're talking the unknown unknowns. You can use this knowledge to start
      learning and
      pushing your testing career and your testing skills to where you always wanted them to be.

    %h2 Self Assessments
    %ps
      &nbsp;
    %p
      At the core of learn testing is the self assessment. You use the assessment to determine what you
      know and what you have yet to learn. We use a self assessment because only you truly know your
      confidence in what you know.
    %p
      We don't share your assessment and other testers on the site won't be able to see what you think.
      We do this so that you're more comfortable tracking your progress.
    %p
      %strong So how does it work?
    %p
      We ask you two questions, one regarding your awareness and understanding of the each topic and
      one regarding how much guidance you need in applying the topic.
    %p
      When you say you don't fully understand the topic, you can discuss it with
      other testers. If you feel you need guidance in application then it's time to find a mentor,
      colleague or friend to sit with, skype with or whatever to improve your skills.

    %h2 An example
    %ps
      &nbsp;
    %p
      So what does a learning objective look like?
    %blockquote
      %p
        %strong
          %i
            Do you understand the difference between identity and anonymous data and the
            impacts it can have on automated data creation?
    %p
      Consider this statement. How well do you understand it? Could you explain it to someone else?
      Can you think of how it relates to your current project or previous projects? What about the
      application? Do you know how to write automated tests that can deal with identity specific data?
    %p
      Once you have considered it, it's time to record your assessment. You support the following
      levels of control. We purposely kept it simple so you don't have to decide whether you have
      "little undersanding" or "some understanding".

      This particular learning comes from the
      %i automation
      discipline. Read on if you want to learn about
      the different software testing disciplines.

    %h2 What is a discipline?
    %ps
      &nbsp;
    %p
      Does performance testing ring a bell? Only to determine the throughput. Terrible I know, but
      performance testing is one of the disciplines we have. A discipline is a classification of
      knowledge within testing. We use it as a way of helping you identify what you want to learn
      so you can say "I want to learn about User Interaction testing" and can easily see all the
      things you can learn that relate to that discipline.
    %p
      %strong
        Disciplines
      %ul
        - LearningObjective::DISCIPLINES.sort.each do |lo|
          %li.large= lo
    %ps
      &nbsp;
    %p
      We also classify knowledge in other ways too, you can read about those next!
    %p
      &nbsp;

    %h2 Categories?
    %ps
      &nbsp;
    %p
      Each discipline consists a set of learnings that a tester can eventually learn.
      Each of these belongs to one the following categories:
    %p
      %ul
        - LearningObjective::CATEGORIES.sort.each do |lo|
          %li.large= lo
    %p
      Each category describes the type of learning. A responsibility is something that, as testers, we
      must do. A technique is a way of approaching a problem. The concepts show us the more theoretical
      aspects of our field and lenses are ways we can use to look at what we are testing.
    %p
      Every learning focuses on the what you can learn and pays scant attention to how you apply it.
      The reason for this is that there are many ways to apply a given learning and it is not for
      us to tell you what you should do in your context. We're more interested in giving you the
      options for learning.
